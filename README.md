# LeetCode SQL-50 🚀

A structured, pattern-focused journey through the **LeetCode SQL-50 Study Plan**, aimed at building strong real-world SQL fundamentals rather than just collecting solutions.

This repository reflects **how I think in SQL** — from basic SELECT queries to complex JOINs and Window Functions.

---

## 🧭 How I Practiced

- Solved problems **topic-wise** (SELECT → JOINS → AGGREGATIONS → SUBQUERIES → WINDOW FUNCTIONS)
- Focused on **query patterns and reasoning**, not memorizing syntax
- Wrote clean, readable SQL with comments explaining *why* the solution works
- Prioritized clarity, correctness, and interview-ready approaches

---

## 🧠 Key SQL Patterns Learned

- LEFT JOIN + NULL filtering for exclusion-based queries  
- INNER vs LEFT JOIN decision-making  
- WHERE vs HAVING in aggregation logic  
- Subqueries vs JOINs: use cases and trade-offs  
- Window functions for ranking, running totals, and analytics

## 🗂 Repository Structure

Each folder represents a SQL concept, and each file corresponds to a LeetCode problem.
LeetCode-SQL-50/
├── Select/
├── Basic-Joins/
├── Aggregations/
├── Subqueries/
├── Window-Functions/


Each `.sql` file contains a clean, well-commented solution explaining the reasoning behind the query.

## 🎯 Purpose of This Repository

This is **not just a collection of answers**.

It demonstrates:
- Structured learning
- Strong SQL fundamentals
- Ability to reason about data problems
- Clean, maintainable query writing

---

## 🚀 Next Steps

- Apply these SQL patterns to real-world datasets
- Practice SQL interview questions
- Explore performance and analytical use cases
